# Google Open Stock Price Trend Predictor using an RNN
This is a Recurrent Neural Network Regression Model that predicts the trend of the Google Open Stock Price for January 2017, using data from 2015 to 2016.
## Dataset
The dataset for this model is already split into a training and test set.
### Training Set
The training set includes the Google Stock price information from the start of 2015 to the end of 2016.
### Test Set
The test set includes the Google Stock price information for January 2017.

## Implementation
I made use of a Python notebook (.ipynb) to implement and train this RNN model. The model was made using the Tensorflow 2.0 library in Python.
